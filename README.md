# Cumulativerse

This is base repository of Cumulativerse company and the idea behind it. It includes definitions, symbols of Cumulativerse and aims to develop them with its community.

While making a profit, we want this company to give something back to community, spread an idea, help both developers and users, stay in ethical and moral boundaries, and to be a part of the future.

## Current Proposal

- Company structure and ideas should be example for other companies and developers.
- We should give away some of our rights to be inspected and directed by community, while maintaining some rights to protect our company.
  - A decentralized community around Cumulativerse should be created and given some rights to inspect company and join decisions.
  - We should be transparent about our decisions and actions.
