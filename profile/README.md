## What is Cumulativerse?

Cumulativerse is a company that give away some of its rights to create a partially decentralized organization. It aims to create a space where it can be inspected and improved by the community, while maintaining a profitable structure.

We want this company to give something back to community, spread an idea, help both developers and users, stay in ethical and moral boundaries, and to be a part of the future.

## Current Proposal

- Company structure and ideas should be example for other companies and developers.
- We should give away some of our rights to be inspected and directed by community, while maintaining some rights to protect our company.
  - A decentralized community around Cumulativerse should be created and given some rights to inspect company and join decisions.
    - A blockchain social network may be created to achieve this without gas fee
    - A discord server robot with admin rights
  - We should be transparent about our decisions and actions.

## How to contribute?
